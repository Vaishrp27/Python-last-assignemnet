        "Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly replicating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It “stretches” the smaller array across the larger array so that their shapes become compatible for element-wise operations.\n",
        "3.What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "A Pandas DataFrame is a 2-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns) in Python.\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas\n",

        "Seaborn extends Matplotlib’s functionality with a simpler, higher-level interface tailored for statistical graphics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Complex Visualizations:\n",
        "It provides easy-to-use functions for complex plots like violin plots, box plots, pair plots, heatmaps, regression plots, and more — with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic Statistical Aggregations:\n",
        "Many Seaborn functions automatically perform statistical aggregations and summarize data (e.g., means with confidence intervals), saving you from manually computing these.\n",
        "6.A What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists\n",
        "array-Homogeneous (all elements same type),Much faster for numerical operations (implemented in C),More memory efficient (compact storage),Supports element-wise operations, broadcasting, linear algebra, and many mathematical functions\n",

        "7.What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",

        "Rows and columns correspond to variables or categories.\n",
        "\n",

        "Instead of iterating element-by-element, NumPy applies the operation simultaneously across all elements, leveraging optimized, low-level implementations in C.\n",

        "Algorithm Compatibility:\n",
